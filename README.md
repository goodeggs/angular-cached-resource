Cached Resource
===============

An [AngularJS][angular] module to interact with RESTful server-side data
sources, even when the browser is offline. Uses HTML5
[localStorage][localStorage] under the hood.  Closely mimics the behavior of
the core [ngResource][ngResource] module, which it requires as a dependency.

## Features

* Provides a simple abstraction to retrieve and save objects from a RESTful
  server.
* Comes with a set of intelligent defaults that let you get started right away.
* Caches all requests, and returns them immediately from the cache if you
  request them again.
* Remmebers writes to the server, and adds them to the cache too.
* If a write fails, try it again periodically until it succeeds. (This even
  works if you refresh the page in between!)
* If you query for multiple resources in one request, each one is cached
  separately so you can request it from the cache individually, too.
* Works as a drop-in replacement for [Angular's $resource][ngResource] module.

## News

It looks like this sort of functionality might be built into the upcoming Angular 2.0.
[Check out the design document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DMacL7iwjSMPP0ytZfugpU4v0PWUK0BT6lhyaVEmlBQ/edit#).

## A simple example

```javascript

// Register your module with ngCachedResource
angular.module('myApp', ['ngCachedResource']);

// Define a resource
var Article = $cachedResource('article', '/articles/:id', {id: "@id"});

// GET requests:
var a1 = Article.get({id: 1});
a1.$promise.then(function() {
  console.log('From cache:', a1);
});
a1.$httpPromise.then(function() {
  console.log('From server:', a1);
});

// POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests:
var a2 = new Article({id: 2});
a2.title = "This article will be saved eventually...";
a2.body = "Even if the browser is offline right now.";
a2.$save();
a2.$promise.then(function() {
  console.log('Article was successfully saved.');
});
```

## Usage
Provides a factory called `$cachedResource`:

```js
$cachedResource(cacheKey, url, [paramDefaults], [actions]);
```

### Arguments

- **cacheKey**, `String`<br>
  An arbitrary key that will uniquely represent this resource in localStorage.
  When the resource is instanciated, it will check localStorage for any

- **url**, `String`<br>
  Exactly matches the API for the `url` param of the [$resource][ngResource]
  factory.

- **paramDefaults**, `Object`, _(optional)_<br>
  Exactly matches the API for the `paramDefaults` param of the
  [$resource][ngResource] factory.

- **actions**, `Object`, _optional_<br>
  Mostly matches the API for the `actions` param of the
  [$resource][ngResource] factory.
  Additionaly takse this params:
  - `cache` (Boolean, default `true`) that determines if this action uses caching.
  - `cacheOnly` (Boolean, default `false`) that determines if this actions works only on cache - ie that it will not touch underlying http resource
  - `cacheParamsKeys` (Array[String], default `null`) that determine params of resource used for generating cache key for resource. It allows for example to ignore specific filtering params on GET action so other actions will use the same cached array. When `null` uses all params. To ignore all params use `[]`.

### Returns

A CachedResource "class" object. This is a swap-in replacement for an object
created by the `$resource` factory, with the following additional properties:

- **Resource.$clearCache(** [options] **)**<br>
  Clears all items from the cache associated with this resource. Accepts one
  argument, described below.

  - **options**, `Object`, *optional*<br>
    `options` may contain the following keys:
      - `where`, which will limit the resources that are cleared from the cache
        to only those whose keys are explicitly listed. `where` can be an `Array`
        or an `Object`. If it is an `Object`, it will be treated like an `Array`
        containing only the provided `Object`. The `Array` should contain `Objects`
        representing cache keys that should be removed. If `where` is provided,
        `exceptFor` must not be provided.
      - `exceptFor`, which will limit the resources that are cleared from the
        cache to all resources except for those whose keys are explicitly listed.
        Just like `where`, `exceptFor` can be an `Array` or an `Object`. If it is an
        `Object`, it will be treated like an `Array` containing only the provided
        `Object`. The `Array` should contain `Object`s representing cache keys that
        should be kept. If `exceptFor` is provided, `where` must not be provided.
      - `isArray`, a boolean. Default is `false`. If `true`, then the function will
        treat the `where` or `exceptFor` arguments as referring to `Array` cache key.
      - `clearChildren`, a boolean. Default is `false`. If `true`, and `isArray` is
        also `true`, then the function will clear the `Array` cache entry (or entries)
        as well as all of the instances that the `Array` points to.
      - `clearPendingWrites`, a boolean. Default is `false`. If `true`, then
        the function will also remove cached instances that have a pending
        write to the server.


In addition, the following properties exist on CachedResource "instance" objects:

- **resource.$promise**<br>
  For GET requests, if anything was already in the cache, this
  promise is immediately resolved (still asynchronously!) even as the HTTP request
  continues. Otherwise, this promise is resolved when the HTTP request responds.

- **resource.$httpPromise**<br>
  For all requests, this promise is resolved as soon as the
  corresponding HTTP request responds.

### Clearing the cache

Since there is a 5 megabyte limit on localStorage in most browsers, you'll
probably want to actively manage the resource instances that are stored. By
default, this module never removes cache entries, so you'll have to do this by
hand. Here are the ways that you can accomplish this:

- **[localStorage.clear()][localStorageClear]**<br>
  Removes everything in localStorage. This will not break the behavior of
  this module, except that it will prevent any pending write from actually
  occurring.

- **$cachedResource.clearCache()**<br>
  Removes every single Angular Cached Resource cache entry that's currently
  stored in localStorage. It will leave all cache entries that were not created
  by this module. (Note: cache entries are namespaced, so if you add anything
  to localStorage with a key that begins with `cachedResource://`, it will get
  deleted by this call). It will also leave any resource instances that have a
  pending write to the server.

- **$cachedResource.clearUndefined()**<br>
  Removes every Angular Cached Resource cache entry corresponding to a resource
  that has not been defined since the page was loaded. This is useful if your
  API changes and you want to make sure that old entries are cleared away.

- **$cachedResource.clearCache({exceptFor: ['foo', 'bar']})**<br>
  Removes every Angular Cached Resource entry except for resources with the
  `foo` or `bar` keys, or resource instances that have a pending write to the
  server.

- **$cachedResource.clearCache({clearPendingWrites: true})**<br>
  Removes every Angular Cached Resource entry, including those that have a
  pending write to the server.

If you have a "class" object that you've created with `$cachedResource`, then
you can also do the following:

- **CachedResource.$clearCache()**<br>
  Removes all entries from the cache associated with this particular resource
  class, except for resource instances that have a pending write to the server.

- **CachedResource.$clearCache({where: [{id: 1}, {id: 2}])**<br>
  Removes two entries from the cache associated with this particular resource
  class; the ones with an `id` of 1 and 2. (This assumes that `paramDefaults`
  has an `id` param.)

- **CachedResource.$clearCache({exceptFor: {id: 1})**<br>
  Removes all entries from the cache associated with this particular resource
  class, except for those with an `id` of 1.  (This assumes that
  `paramDefaults` has an `id` param.)

- **CachedResource.$clearCache({exceptFor: {query: 'search string'}, isArray: true})**<br>
  Removes all entries from the cache except those that were returned by the
  provided query parameters.

- **CachedResource.$clearCache({clearPendingWrites: true})**<br>
  Removes all instances of CachedResource from the cache, including those that
  have a pending write to the server.

------

## Details

**Asking for a cached resource with `get` or `query` will do the following:**

1. If the request has not been made previously, it will immediately return a
   `resource` object, just like usual. The request will go through to the
   server, and when the server responds, the resource will be saved in a
   localStorage cache.

2. If the request has already been made, it will immediately return a
   `resource` object that is pre-populated from the cache. The request will
   still attempt to go through to the server, and if the server responds, the
   cache entry will be updated.

**Updating a CachedResource object will do the following:**

1. Add the resource update action to a queue.
2. Immediately attempt to flush the queue by sending all the network requests
   in the queue.
3. If a queued network request succeeds, remove it from the queue and resolve
   the promises on the associated resources (only if the queue entry was made
   after the page was loaded)
4. If the queue contains requests, attempt to flush it once per minute OR
   whenever the browser sends a [navigator.onOnline][onOnline] event.

**What if localStorage doesn't exist, or if the browser is out of space?**

In either of these cases, `$cachedResource` will make sure all of your requests
still happen.  Things end up working just like the `$resource` module, with
none of the caching benefits.
